		<h2>About Cupid</h2>
		<p id="p1">Cupid is the Greek god of love, or better said he is the one that makes people fall in love. For this purpose, he owns a bow and some quite magical arrows. Once shot by one of these, a person falls madly in love with another of Cupid's choice. This action of his is commonly refered to as Cupid's Poison, for which there is no known cure.</p>

		<h1>Cupid's weapons</h1>
		<ul class="weapons">
			<li>Bow - His bow is made of willow wood, painted in gold.</li>
			<li>Arrow - His arrows have a silver pointed end and gold accents. Most of them lack feathers, but if they do posses them, they are a dark red. He never runs out of them and they never miss their target.</li>
			<li>Love potion - His love potion is a secret even to the gods.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Random facts</h2>
		<p>He likes to joke and cause mischief. He tends to threaten to shoot people, but his friends are already imune to his empty words.</p>
		<p>He is highly dramatic and excentric.</p>
		<p>One of his best friends is Dionysus, seen as they share a common taste for chaotic behaviour and dramatics. In a weird way he also gets along pretty well with Artemis. You can read more about those two in the links below:</p>
