		<h2>About Cupid</h2>
		<p>Cupid is the greek god of love. He owns a bow and an arrow which uses to shoot people who then proceed to fall in love.</p>
		<img id="arrow" src="img/arrow.jpeg">
		<p>His shooting is commonly refered to as Cupid's Poison, for which there is no known cure.</p>
		<h1>Cupid's weapons</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Bow</li>
			<p>His bow is made of willow wood, painted in gold.</p>
			<li>Arrow</li>
			<p>His arrows have a silver end and gold accents, with red feathers at one end. He never runs out of them and they never miss their target.</p>
			<li>Love potion</li>
			<p>His love potion is a secret even to the gods.</p>
		</ul>
		<h2>Random facts</h2>
		<p>He likes to joke about shooting people and threatens with that every single time, his friends are already imune to his threats.</p>
		<p>He is highly dramatic and excentric.</p>
		<p>One of his best friends is Dionysus, seen as they share a common taste for chaotic behaviour and dramatics. In a weird way he also gets along pretty well with Artemis You can read more about him in the links below:</p>
